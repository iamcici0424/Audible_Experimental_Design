## Introduction

The Engagement Marketing Team is designing an email campaign to 1 million customers of Audible. Their goals are to increase customer retention and decrease subscription cancellation. As a marketing specialist of The insights team here, I was asked to help them achieve the goal, design the email marketing testing plan and present the findings. 

* This is an individual project and 10 pages maximum.

## Required Instructions

* Propose an outline of testing plan. Please be specific about the details of the design.
* Suppose you concluded that the test was successful. With the test result, you are about to communicate to the marketing team. What kind of insights would you present and what would be your recommendations?
* What KPIs would you define to measure its success? Consider that the goal will be acquiring as many customers as possible (short-term), but making sure we create sustained value for the company by acquiring customer that would remain with Audible for a long time (long-term).
